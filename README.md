  <b>chantilly</b> is a tool for deploying <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning">online machine learning</a> models built with <a href="https://github.com/creme-ml/creme">creme</a> into production. It takes care of building API routes, visualizing activity, monitoring performance, and alerting you if something goes wrong.

> python setup.py develop
> make test
> export FLASK_ENV=development
> chantilly run
```

## Roadmap

- **HTTP long polling**: clients can interact with `creme` over a straightforward HTTP protocol. Therefore the speed bottleneck comes from the web requests, not from the machine learning. We would like to provide a way to interact with `chantilly` via long-polling. This means that a single connection can be used to process multiple predictions and model updates, which reduces the overall latency.
- **Grafana dashboard**: The current dashboard is a quick-and-dirty proof of concept. In the long term, we would like to provide a straighforward way to connect with a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) instance without having to get your hands dirty. Ideally, we would like to use SQLite as a data source for simplicity reasons. However, The Grafana team [has not planned](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/1542#issuecomment-425684417) to add support for SQLite. Instead, they encourage users to use [plugins](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/plugins/developing/datasources/). We might also look into [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/).
